# SQL Basics Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic SQL functionalities including database manipulation, table creation, data insertion, updates, and complex queries using `CASE`, `GROUP BY`, and aggregate functions.

## Steps

1. **Show Databases**: Displays all databases present on the server.
2. **Create and Use Database**: Switch to the `RD` database.
3. **Table Creation**: Create a table named `revenue` to store material and their associated purchase amounts.
4. **Data Insertion**: Insert initial data into the `revenue` table.
5. **Data Querying**: Demonstrates `SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, and filtering using `HAVING`.
6. **Data Manipulation**: Insert additional data and update existing records.
7. **Conditional Logic**: Use `CASE` statements to categorize investments and ROI.
8. **Aggregation**: Calculate the average ROI across all records.
9. **Sorting and Aggregating**: 
   - **Step 17**: Order the results by the difference (profit) in descending order.
   - **Step 18**: Count the total number of stocks and calculate the sum of profits.
